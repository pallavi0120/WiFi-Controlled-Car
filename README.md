# WiFi-Controlled Car

An ESP8266-based WiFi-controlled car using L298N motor driver.

---

## Project Goal  
The main goal of this project is to build a prototype of a car that can be controlled using a mobile phone through WiFi, while sitting at our place.

---

## What I Used  
I used an ESP8266 NodeMCU to receive commands from the mobile phone and control the carâ€™s movement.

---

## What I Learned  
This project helped me understand how wireless systems work and how such technology can be used in real-life applications like surveillance, smart robots, or automation systems.

It's a practical application of IoT (Internet of Things) in building real-life solutions.
